# My Portfolio
## Description
Within this project, I was able to create a web application that acts as my personal web-development portfolio. The webpage displays various sections, including a personal photo and introduction, an 'About Me' section, a 'My Work' section, as well as some contact details in the final section.

## Installation
The application requires no installation as it is a live webpage.

## Usage
To utilise this application you can visit the webpage by following this URL: https://harrynewt0n.github.io/my-portfolio/. This should open up a webpage that looks like:

![Alt text](<assets/images/portfolio website.png>)

You can navigate to the various sections by clicking on them in the nav bar, which will direct you to the correct section of the webpage.

By clicking on the project images you will be redirected to the deployed application of that project.
